  "Passionate about computers for as long as I can remember, I began my career as a PHP developer in 2009. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects across various industries, which has given me a comprehensive perspective on projects and their challenges.",
  "In 2021, I joined Akawaka, a young, human-sized IT consulting firm based in Lyon, where I collaborate with a passionate team. Together, we strive to deliver high-quality services to our clients, supported by continuous internal training. My commitment to quality is reflected in my Opquast certification, and I am also aiming for Symfony certification soon.",
  "Outside of my profession, I am an avid reader and an electronic music enthusiast. In my spare time, I enjoy DJing, another way for me to fuel my creativity. Naturally curious, I am always eager to learn and explore new horizons.",
  "Over time, I decided to leave social media to better focus on my family, work, and passions. With this in mind, I chose to share my analyses and reflections through this blog, which serves primarily as a personal archive. Therefore, don't expect regular updates.",
  "To protect my time, I haven't provided any direct contact methods, except for my LinkedIn, which I check occasionally. All professional inquiries should be directed to our sales representative Mathilde.",
  "Today, I continue to explore the world of web development with the same passion as when I started, bringing my experience and creativity to the clients I support, while maintaining a rigorous and high-quality approach.",
