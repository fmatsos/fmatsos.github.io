After a career with many experiences, I joined [Akawaka](https://www.akawaka.fr) in 2021, a young IT company based in Lyon, where I support our customers on various projects.
[Opquast](https://directory.opquast.com/fr/certificat/BVARDQ/) certified for Web quality, I'm also aiming for Symfony certification.
